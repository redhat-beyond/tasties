### Introduction
Welcome to Tasties! We're creating an open-source platform where people can share and discover recipes,
and get the most out of their available ingredients. On Tasties, users will be able to see, comment on and rate
other people's recipes - as well as publish their own. Users will be able to search recipes by rating, style,
as well as by the ingredients that they call for.
